### About the Project
Welcome to my Capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate through the Data Analytics program with Merit America.  

I was tasked with conducting a case study, imagining myself to be a marketing analyst for the company, Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women.  
### About the Data
18 datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. 
30 eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.
